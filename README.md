# Full Stack Application

## Description

This is a full-stack application built using **NestJS** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **MongoDB** for the database. The entire application is containerized using Docker and can be run with a single command.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS for phishing simulation and attempts management.
- **Frontend**: React for user interaction and management.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user info and phishing attempts.
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerization.

## Project Structure

```bash
app/
├── backend/           # Backend (NestJS)
├── frontend/          # Frontend (React)
├── docker-compose.yml # Docker Compose configuration
└── mongo_data/           # MongoDB data (volume)
```

## How to Run

Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd phishing
```

Copy the .env.example files and rename them to .env for both frontend and backend:

• For backend:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

• For frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### The application will be accessible on the following ports:

Backend: <http://localhost:3001>

Frontend: <http://localhost:3000>

MongoDB: localhost:27017

### Stopping the Application

To stop and remove all running containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Notes

• MongoDB data is persisted in the db_data/ directory.

• Ensure that .env files are set up in both the backend/ and frontend/ directories before running the app.

### Troubleshooting

• Docker Issues: If you encounter any Docker issues, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly.

• Port Conflicts: Make sure that the ports 3000, 3001, and 27017 are not being used by other services on your system.
